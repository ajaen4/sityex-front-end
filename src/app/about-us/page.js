            My name is Alberto. Inspired by my challenging experiences with
            finding a place to live and navigating the required paperwork in
            Sweden and Italy, I founded SityEx. I believed in the necessity of a
            simple, single platform to assist expats in settling in.

            I envision a world where everyone has the freedom to live in any
            city they choose. That&apos;s why SityEx was createdâ€”to make
            settling into a new place simpler and more accessible for everyone.
            Together, let&apos;s make this journey a shared success.
